Question:

        (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the 
        following 2 * 2 system of linear equation: 
        ax + by = e
        cx + dy = f 
        x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc) y = (af - ec)/(ad - bc)  
        Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y: 
        3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5 
        2.1x + .55y = 5.9
        
Code:

            public class s_1_13 {

              public static void main (String args[]){

                double a = 3.4;
                double b = 50.2;
                double c = 2.1;
                double d = .55;
                double e = 44.5;
                double f = 5.9;

                double x = (e * d - b * f) / (a * d - b * c);
                double y = (a * f - e * c) / (a * d - b * c);

                System.out.println("x = " + x + " y = " + y);
      }
    }
